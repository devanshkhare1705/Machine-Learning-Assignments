# Machine-Learning-Assignments
My programming answers for CSC311: Introduction To Machine Learning course at University of Toronto

# Course Background
CSC311: Introduction to Machine Learning was a supplemental course for my Certificate in Artificial Intelligence (AECERAIEN) during my B.A.Sc. at University of Toronto. This course covered the mathematical theory and implementation of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms spanning supervised and unsupervised learning. 

Supervised Learning Methods:

  Nonparametric Models - kNNs, Decision Tree Classifiers

  Parametric Models - Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Softmax Regression, Neural Networks, Naive Bayes, Gaussian Discriminant Analysis

Unsupervised Learning Methods:

  Principal Component Analysis, Matrix Completion, Autoencoders, K-Means, Expectation Maximization


The code for course assignments has been attached in the repository.
